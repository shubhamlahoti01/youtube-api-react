I have built a YouTube clone React application utilizing the YouTube v3 API from RapidAPI (https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31). The application includes various features, such as a search functionality with categories and mobile responsiveness for seamless viewing across different screen sizes.
